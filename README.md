Design process
I already had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do with my website before I started

Wireframes
I created a wireframe in draw.io after I started, changed it once, and then stuck to it, apart from the footer which I moved to be a scroller on the right side of the screen

Usability considerations
My website is high contrast, the colour scheme might be a little jarring for first time users

Between 1989 and 1991 the first web servers were developed.

Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

Domains - a label that defines a network domain. What you type in to get to a specific site.

Web Servers - A server that hosts web sites on the internet. It's where the website is hosted.

DNS - Domain Name Server (or System) - It turns a domain into a numeric IP Address.

Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

The fact that the internet exists at all has contributed excessively to the world today, it's made the lives of plenty of people easier, and some more enjoyable, I know I use a VOIP program to talk to hundreds of people almost daily because that's what I like to do to unwind, but that same VOIP service is used to host conferences and connect people in certain fields with eachother over long distances.
