					<h1>About me</h1>
					<p>
						I've been on a rather interesting journey toward figuring out what I really want to do, and what my 
						passion is, in terms of my career. After graduating from Australian Christian College in 2015 I took
						a gap year during which I went through several volunter positions, the most notable of which were:
						first, A tour guide at the Queensland Maritime Museum, I was in this position for roughly
						three months and ended in the middle of November of 2016, it taught me how to properly hold a
						conversation with people I didn't know, and how to convey information in a manner that is both
						easily understandable, and engaging without losing the interest of those to whom I am speaking.
					</p>
					<p>
						My second volunteer position was as a part of a group of volunteer house painters for a council 
						run refurbishment program where I alongside a few other volunteers repainted the buildings on
						the Mt Gravatt showgrounds, this also lasted between three and four months and ended in February
						2017.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reason that I call these two positions notable is because they were the only two positions from 
						which I felt like I gained important trasnferable skills, from the tour guide position I learned
						conversational and teaching skills, how to absorb and retain information quickly, and
						how to properly converse with people who might not fully understand you. From the painting job
						I learned the importance of a hard days work, how to effectively work as part of a team, and that
						many hands make for light work. I call these skills "important transferable skills"
						is because they are important sills for any workplace, the other volunteer positions I was in
						during this time definitely taught me things, but not things that are as important in any
						workplace other than the areas I was volunteering in.
